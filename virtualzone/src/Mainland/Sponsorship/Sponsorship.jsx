          <p style={{width:"30em", display:"block"}}>One of the most common questions asked by first-time entrepreneurs in this part of the world is whether they need a local sponsor (Nominee Shareholder) in Dubai. The answer depends on many factors, including your nationality and the type of business you wish to set up.</p>
          <p style={{width:"30em", display:"block"}}>If you’re a non-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) national looking to set up a business with a commercial or industrial licence on the United Arab Emirates mainland, then yes, you will need a local sponsor as a business partner. If, however, you are setting up in a free zone, or your business activity is covered by a professional services licence, a local sponsor is not required.</p>
          <h2 style={{width:"25em", display:"block"}}>If your business does require a local sponsor, Virtuzone is on hand to help.</h2>
          <p  style={{width:"30em", display:"block"}}>First, you’ll need to establish a mainland Limited Liability Company (LLC)—of which you retain 49% ownership with the other 51% going to the local sponsor. Rest assured, however, that profits are not split along the same lines and your local partner will have little-to-no say in the day-to-day running of your company.</p>
          <p style={{width:"30em", display:"block"}}>Finding a local sponsor in Dubai, can be a demanding process for startups and new entrepreneurs. The local sponsor must either be a UAE national (also knows as an Emirati) or a corporate entity. The corporate entity must be completely owned by UAE nationals and comprised of a board of directors.</p>

      <h1>1. No interference from the sponsor</h1>
        <p>With corporate sponsorship, entrepreneurs maintain complete control over their business, despite the local sponsor holding a narrow majority of the company shares.</p>
        <p>As a rule, corporate local sponsor does not get involved in the day-to-day running of the company, allowing business owners to continue to have full management of their staff, clients, and service offering</p>
        <h1>2. Easy</h1>
        <p>We’ll do all the heavy lifting—that’s what makes us the premier business setup consultants in Dubai and the UAE. Virtuzone is a one-stop-shop for company formation. We manage the process from start to finish, meaning you don’t have to meet with countless government department authorities to get your business up and running.</p>
        <h1>3. In-depth proactive contracts</h1>
        <p>Side agreements are often a difficult part of the process. Luckily, this is another area in which corporate sponsorship may be advantageous. Many corporate sponsors offer detailed contracts drafted by first-tier legal counsel, so that the rights of the business owner and their shareholders are fully protected.</p>
