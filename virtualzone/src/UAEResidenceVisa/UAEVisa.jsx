        <h1 style={{textAlign:"left"}}>What is a UAE Residence Visa?</h1>
        <p style={{marginTop:"-0.8em"}}>UAE residence visa is a document that allows foreigners to live in the<br />
        United Arab Emirates for extended periods of time. Unlike short stay visa<br />
        options such as the tourist visa, residence visas are typically valid for<br />
        between 2 and 3 years, but they can be extended up to 10 years through<br />
        renewals.<br />
        In fact, many UAE expatriates continuously renew their visas so that they<br />
        and their family members can stay in this country.<br />
        The reason why getting a UAE residence visa is so important is that the<br />
        UAE does not offer permanent residency. Instead, foreigners are simply<br />
        allowed to constantly renew their visas so that they can continue living in<br />
        the country.</p>

      <h1>How Can I Become a UAE Resident?</h1>
        <p >There are a few different ways that someone can become a resident of the UAE. These include:</p>
        <ul >
          <li>Obtaining a job in the UAE</li>
          <li>Opening a business in the UAE</li>
          <li>Getting a freelance permit for the UAE</li>
          <li>Enrolling in a university or college</li>
          <li>Be a dependent of a resident</li>
          <li>Obtain a UAE Golden visa</li>
          <li>Own property worth more than 1 million AED</li>
        </ul>
        <p >While there are many different ways of obtaining UAE residence, some are faster than others. Currently, opening your own business in the UAE is the fastest way to get a visa.</p>
        <p>To open your own business, all you need to do is use your legal name to open a company under the UAE’s business registration authorities.</p>
        <p >With more than 40 of these groups in the UAE, it’s easy to register your business. Plus, doing so involves transparent and affordable fees, making it an extra convenient way to get UAE residency.</p>
        <h1 >Where Can I Live With a UAE Residence Visa?</h1>
        <p>One of the first questions people have about getting a UAE residence visa is where they’re able to live under their new visa. The good news is that they can live
        in any Emirate they like!</p>

        <p>Whether you obtain a UAE visa in Dubai or a different Emirate, you’re allowed to rent an apartment and settle down in any location you like. There are no
        restrictions on where in the UAE you’re allowed to live.</p>

        <p>What’s important to note is that you can only get a driver’s license in the Emirate where your visa was issued. That means if you opened a business in Dubai,
        you’ll need to acquire a Dubai driver’s license.</p>

        <p>Speaking of Dubai, many people choose to settle in this Emirate because of the amazing entertainment and infrastructure there. However, if you want to live
        in Dubai you should note that residency is a little more expensive in this area.</p>

        <h1>The Process of Getting a Residence Visa in UAE?</h1>
        <p>Getting a UAE residence visa is very simple. If you’re planning to get a visa by establishing a mainland company you’ll need to follow this process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Register your company</li>
            <li>Get an establishment card</li>
            <li>Receive your entry permit</li>
            <li>Apply for an Emirates ID</li>
            <li>Take your required medical tests</li>
            <li>Stamp your passport with your UAE visa</li>
        </ul>

        <p>One of the great things about getting a UAE visa is that you can get the process completed from your home country. The only parts of the process that you’ll
        need to complete in the UAE are the medical exams and the passport stamping.</p>

        <p>It’s important to note that these two processes typically take about five business days. You won’t be able to leave the country until the process is complete, so
        make sure to plan accordingly.</p>

        <h1>How Much Does It Cost to Become a UAE Resident?</h1>
        <p>Becoming a UAE resident will cost different amounts of money depending on what type of visa you have and where your business is registered.</p> 
        <p>For example, the lowest visa fees apply to the northern Emirates of Umm Al Quwain, Sharjah, Ras Al Khaimah, and Ajman.</p>
        <p>If you want to start a business in Dubai you’ll need to pay slightly higher fees. This is due to higher business registration costs as well as mandatory health
        insurance coverage.</p>       

        <h1>What are the Benefits of Getting a UAE Residence Visa?</h1>
        <p>There are many benefits to becoming one of the 8.84 million ex-pats living in the UAE.</p>
        <p>For one, you’re able to easily visit this country without having to worry about constantly applying for tourist visas. This is especially true for countries that are
        not immediately eligible for tourist visas in the UAE.</p>


        <p>Additionally, it makes it easy for you to acquire a bank account in Dubai. This can be a game-changer for investors and corporations looking to expand
         operations to the UAE.</p>

        <h1>How Do I Maintain My UAE Residence Visa?</h1>
        <p>Once you have your residence visa, you’ll need to keep your visa valid. Luckily, this is pretty easy.</p>
        <p>All you need to do is make sure that you enter the UAE once every six months. If you don’t fulfil this requirement, you’ll be required to reapply for a visa.</p>
        
        <h1>How Do I Renew a UAE Residence Visa?</h1>
        <p>Once your visa expires, you’ll need to renew it in order to legally remain in the UAE. This process is much simpler than getting your original visa.</p>
        <p>To renew your visa, you’ll need to get a medical checkup at a screening centre roughly 1-2 weeks prior to the date your visa expires. At the appointment, you’ll 
        be required to take several tests.</p>
        <p>Once you have your medical results, send the report to the immigration office along with your passport. The immigration office will stamp your passport and
        you’ll be able to stay in the UAE for another period!</p>
